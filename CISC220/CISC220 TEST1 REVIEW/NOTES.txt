Hi everybody!

There were some interesting questions brought up in Wednesday's tutorial about the behaviour of spaces in Bash.

For the most part, you're okay to do spaces how you like but there are a few gotchas.

1.
When assigning a variable, don't put a space on either side of the =
MYVAR=5 <-- nice!
MYVAR = 5 <-- no!

2.
When writing an if statement with a negation, put a space after the !
if ! [[ 4 > 3 ]] <-- nice!
if ![[ 4 > 3 ]] <-- no!

3.
When writing an if statement with [[ ]] brackets, put spaces after the [[ and before the ]]
if [[ 4 > 3 ]] <-- nice!
if [[ 4>3 ]] <-- also nice!
if [[4>3]] <-- no!

4.
This is ok!
(( X = 4 * 2 ))

So is this!
((X=4*2))
